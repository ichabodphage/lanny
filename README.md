## dependancies
SFML (used for graphics, audio, and IO)

## build
requirements
1. visual studio 2019 or beyond
2. SFML 
3. machine that has x64 architecture

### step one
downloaded the github repo onto any windows, macos, or linux device

### step two
create a Visual studio project from the github repo that was just downloaded

(link for how to do that)
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/how-to-create-a-cpp-project-from-existing-code?view=msvc-170

### step three
import SFML into the visual studio project

(link for how to do that)
https://www.sfml-dev.org/tutorials/2.5/start-vc.php

### step four
set the visual studio solution platform to x64 and then set the build type to release
finally the engine can be built by just navigating to the VS build menu and pressing build solution
